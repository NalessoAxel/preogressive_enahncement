## What is it?

It's a single langding page.
This is a the story of an old chinese farmer.



## What's the purpose of this?
  Our goal for this exercice was to learn the basics from html & CSS.
  We start with the squeleton of our landing page wich is the HTML.
  We start with the header, we use h1 attribute to set the title of the page.

  Then we had to make a list of stupid things :smirk: using 
  ```
<ul>, <li>
``` 

  After, we put some images to our Html. using 
  ```
  <img>
  ```
  Then we add some 
  ```
   <p>
  ```
  to our text.
